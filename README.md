Please I am a new learner of linear programming and I am so interested in the topic. However, for my PhD thesis I am faced with several difficulties in using multi-objective optimization to solve problems.
Using genetic algorithms,I wish to optimize finance and investment for PV power generation in a system model for developing countries where energy access is limited for economic growth amid environmental constraints.
Therefore, how to sustain economic growth by providing adequate energy access while simultaneously reducing carbon emission imprints and power generation cost.
I have as objective to minimize economic cost for solar PV, minimize investment risk for PV and maximize energy use (or energy consumption).
Please, how can I proceed to build such a system, what steps should I take to build this model and use MOOP solutions.
Please, I need help.
